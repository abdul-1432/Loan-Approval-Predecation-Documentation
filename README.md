# Loan Approval Prediction Documentation

## Overview

The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on various applicant and loan features. This documentation provides a detailed guide on the project, including setup instructions, methodology, and usage.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (`loan_data.csv`).
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Source code directory.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - `feature_engineering.py`: Script for feature engineering.
  - `model_training.py`: Script for training machine learning models.
  - `predict.py`: Script for making loan approval predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset (`loan_data.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- `Gender`: Applicant's gender (Male/Female).
- `Married`: Applicant's marital status (Yes/No).
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents.
- `Education`: Applicant's education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).
- `Self_Employed`: Self-employment status (Yes/No).
- `ApplicantIncome`: Applicant's income.
- `CoapplicantIncome`: Co-applicant's income.
- `LoanAmount`: Loan amount requested (in thousands).
- `Loan_Amount_Term`: Term of loan (in months).
- `Credit_History`: Credit history meets guidelines (1: Yes, 0: No).
- `Property_Area`: Applicant's property area (Urban/Semiurban/Rural).
- `Loan_Status`: Loan approval status (Y: Approved, N: Not Approved).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge.
   - Perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

## Model Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Precision: 88%
  - Recall: 82%
  - F1-score: 85%

- **Random Forest:**
  - Accuracy: 88%
  - Precision: 90%
  - Recall: 86%
  - F1-score: 88%

- **Gradient Boosting:**
  - Accuracy: 89%
  - Precision: 91%
  - Recall: 87%
  - F1-score: 89%

## Usage

To use the loan approval prediction model:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Run the `predict.py` script with new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --data path/to/your/new_data.csv
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/new_data.csv` with the path to your new data file containing loan application information.
